Metrics


There are many which will be specific to your product, but the major ones would include:

1. Activity statistics
Shows the amount of registered users during the first week/month/year. Shows the activity of already registered users (how often do they visit the web page, how long do they stay there, which pages are the most frequently visited).
2. Average transaction duration
Average time when user manages to complete a transaction. 
3. Number of application downloads.
Helps to estimate how many people download and use the application. The more the number of downloads is, the more probability that application will be successful.
4. Ratio of successful transactions among all transactions.
Enables us to evaluate number of users who complete the transactions among them who uses the application.  
5. Customer lifetime value
Estimates the profits in the long run.

This should give you a sense of 
1) traction,
2) retention, 
3) engagement over time. 

These trends can be graphed and mapped to feature improvements, marketing campaigns, etc., and can be leveraged to attract investors and partners to your startup.
