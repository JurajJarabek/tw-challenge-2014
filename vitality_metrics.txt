There are many which will be specific to your product, but the major ones would include:

User registrations over time
User visits over time
User activity over time
Average time that user spend doing one transaction
How many downloads from Apple Store/Google Play
Comparison of all transactions with successful

This should give you a sense of 
1) traction,
2) retention, 
3) engagement over time. 

These trends can be graphed and mapped to feature improvements, marketing campaigns, etc., and can be leveraged to attract investors and partners to your startup.
